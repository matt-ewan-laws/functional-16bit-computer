# functional-16bit-computer

A functional reimplementation of the LLVMJS as described within the YouTube series [16-Bit Virtual Machine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP29wDx6QmW5DdwpdwHCRJsEubS5NrQ9b) by [Low Level JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56l7uZA209tlPTVOJiJ8Tw/playlists).

## Rationale

It should be obvious but first and foremost this is a hobby project for fun. The original implementation is likely orders of magnitude more efficient that this one.

I chose to build functional implementation mainly because it will be easy to implement time travel functionality.
